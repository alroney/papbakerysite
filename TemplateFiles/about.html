                        <p>
                            Welcome to Andrew's Paws and Palms Bakery! We are a small business that
                            bake and sell dog treats and baked goods for people. We are located in
                            Hanover, PA USA in a residential home. The business started out with
                            doing some personal baking for myself and then I decided to try making
                            dog treats for my dog, Zoey. I started making dog treats for Zoey because
                            I wanted to make sure that she was eating healthy and safe treats.
                            <br><span id="fullStory">
                            I informed myself and to others that I would start taking on baking when
                            I moved out of my parents house in March 2023. I had a lot of people
                            support my decision this is especially true for my parents. In fact, my
                            step-mother, Tiffany, was the one who kick started the whole process by 
                            surprising me with a book ,via delivery, about bread making and now I
                            was not the only one invested into my baking decision. Mrs. Tiff has 
                            elminated the hardest part for me, knowing where to start.
                            I am very grateful for her and my parents for supporting me in my
                            decision.
                            <br>
                            The first thing I started baking was bread, and more specifically the
                            first bread being 'Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Loaves'. It was simple
                            to make and contained some of my favorite ingredients. The bread was
                            delicious and I was very proud of myself for making it. I was so proud
                            of myself that I decided to share it with my friends and family. I
                            received a lot of positive feedback from them and they encouraged me
                            to continue baking and so I did. My next bread was 'Irish Soda Bread',
                            this is where I had my first failure. I misread the recipe and swapped
                            the amounts of sugar and salt. The bread was so salty that it was
                            inedible. I was very shocked at first but I was not discouraged. I
                            laughed it off and tried again. I was determined to make the bread
                            and I did. I was very proud of myself for not giving up and I was
                            very happy with the results. I shared the bread with my family and
                            they loved it.
                            <br>
                            After several successful breads, Mrs. Tiff surprised me again with
                            a book on cakes. I was very excited to start baking cakes and I
                            started with a simple vanilla cake. This is where I had my second
                            failure. The cake pan that I had was a detachable pan and I never
                            thought to put it on a baking sheet. The cake batter leaked out
                            of the pan and onto the bottom of the oven. I was very upset with
                            myself but I was not discouraged. I cleaned up the mess and tried
                            again. I was determined to make the cake and I did. My second attempt
                            I put a rectangular baking sheet in the round pan and it did work,
                            there was no leakage; however, the cake was not smoothly round due
                            to the baking sheet. I was very proud of myself for not giving up
                            and I was very happy with the results. On my third attempt, I
                            had finally put the cake pan on a baking sheet and the cake was
                            perfectly round. I made homemade whipped vanilla frosting to
                            cover the cake with. I shared the cake with my family and they loved.
                            For Mother's Day I made a 'Cinnimon Spice' cake for my mother and
                            decorated it using my new decorating kit that I had gotten after my
                            third cake. Despite my beginner skills in cake decorating, it actually
                            turned out pretty good. My mother loved the cake and she was very
                            proud of me.
